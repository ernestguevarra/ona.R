A simple example using ona.R -- good eats
========================================================

ona.R makes is easy to download and work with datasets on [ona](https://ona.io). After downloading, ona.R post-processes your dataset to convert the different columns to the correct type, which it derives from the `type` you specified during the creation of your XLSform.

Let us illustrate this with a simple example:

```{r read, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../formhub.R")
# Download the dataset named good_eats in the account of mberg
# NOTE: We need to @data to retrieve the dataframe from the return object
good_eats <- formhubDownload("good_eats", "mberg")@data
```

The downloaded data has its fields converted to the right types, something we'll look at in depth later. Before we do that, lets present a quick example of the power of these conversions by looking at dates. Can we look at how much data mberg has been submitting over time?

```{r plot1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data=good_eats, x=submit_date) + ylab("Submission Count")
```

How about riskiness of the food he is trying and reporting about... has that changed over time?
```{r plot2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
qplot(data=good_eats, x=submit_date, fill=risk_factor)
```
Looks like it has! mberg's getting riskier as time goes on.
